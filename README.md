Videogrep
=========

Videogrep searches through dialog in video files (using .srt subtitle tracks) and makes supercuts based on what it finds.

##Requirements
Clone this repository, and then install [pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-search) and [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy) along with the other requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/). If you're on a mac with homebrew you can install ffmpeg with:
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

You may need to change the path to your installation of ffmpeg by modifying the first line of videogrep.py:
```python
FFMPEG_BINARY = '/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg'
```

##How to use it
The most basic use:
```
python videogrep.py --input path/to/video_or_folder --search 'search phrase'
```

###Options

videogrep can take a number of options:

####--input / -i
Video or subtitle file, or folder containing multiple files

####--output / -o
Name of the file to generate. By default this is "supercut.mp4"

####--search / -s
Search term

####--search-type / -st
Type of search you want to perform. There are three options:
* re: [regular expression](http://www.pyregex.com/) (this is the default).
* pos: part of speech search (uses [pattern.search](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-search)). For example 'JJ NN' would return all lines of dialog that contain an adjective followed by a noun.
* hyper: hypernym search. For example 'body parts' grabs all lines of dialog that reference a body part

####--max-clips / -m 
Maximum number of clips to use for the supercut

####--test / -t
Show the search results without making the supercut

####--randomize / -r
Randomize the order of the clips

####--padding / -p
Padding in milliseconds to add to the start and end of each clip
